At the foot of each incomplete todo instance, there is a link to complete and to delete the todo. Completed todos follow the same format, replacing the link to complete with a link to mark it as incomplete again. *As a note, friends will be able to see your todo list on your profile page, but will not be able to edit it.
* **Friends**: This is the page to view your friends information in its entirety. You can respond to friend requests. Clicking on usernames will bring you to that person's user profile page.
  * **User Page**: Here, you can interact with the user associated with this page. If you and the user are friends, the user's todos, friends, and groups are displayed here but are unable to be modified. If there is no friend association between you and the user, the page will not display this, but prompt to add the user as a friend. Click the dropdown at the beginning of the page and select _"Add Friend"_. . The user who initiated the group task is listed in the todo information. *User Messages are still being developed and will not work at this time.
* **Groups**: This page will show you all groups you are associated with, and has an option to create a group of your own! Simply click the button _"Create Group"_ sitting above the list. A dialogue box will pop up to have you specify the group name. Clicking on the group name will bring you to that group's page
  * **Group Page**: Here, you can interact with the group and its users. Users that are a part of the group can see other users associated with the page and create group tasks. These are todos for the group that anyone can create, update and delete. The user who initiated the group task is listed in the todo information. To join the group, simply click the dropdown at the beginning of the page and select _"Join Group"_ *Group Messages are still being developed and will not work at this time.
* **Logout**: Clicking Logout will sign you out of your current session and then redirect you to the login page. Thank you for using _Just ToDo-It_!
* **Search**: Clicking Search will bring up a search dialogue. From here, you can search for users, friends, groups, and your todos. For todos, it will display whether or not it is completed.
